## About The Project
This project was done as part of our university project in the Web Engineering course.


This project is about a web application that displays, updates, deletes data from a large dataset which can be found here, https://github.com/owid/co2-data.
We used java for the backend, react for the front-end and mysql as a database to store the data.
